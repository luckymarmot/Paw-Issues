# Paw HTTP Client

This is the Public Issue Tracker for Paw. If you're using Paw and have found some bugs, please feel free to email me, or [create an Issue here](https://github.com/LuckyMarmot/Paw/issues). I'll always appreciate your help. Also, please never hesitate to create an issue for a tiny bug, a UI problem, a keyboard shortcut that you'd love to have, or a feature you'd like to see in the next release.

Every detail count!

The next version of Paw will use a new text / completion mechanism, so please don't waste your time with some bugs related to the text views/fields.

I'm actually not using this repo to track the issues I create myself. But I'll be constantly checking your issues here and giving some updates. I'll close an issue when the next version of Paw containing the fix/new feature will be live.

Thanks a lot for enjoying Paw and for helping!

# What is Paw?

Paw is an HTTP Client for Mac.

Easily craft your HTTP requests, try them, archive them. Setup HTTP Headers, URL parameters, form-encoded POST key-values or text. Get easy-to-read responses with well formatted headers and body.

[Learn more about Paw](http://luckymarmot.com/paw)

* Smart Autocompletion: a rich database of HTTP headers and their most common values, and ads your entry for future completions.

* Response Formatting: responses are automatically formatted, and colored (JSON, XML, HTML, RSS...).

* Simply write your URL: Paw colors it to make it more readable,
and parses the parameters as a key-value table. Or enter parameters in the table, it will add them to the URL.

* Web & Images display: Compose the most complicated HTTP request and visualize the result like if it was in your browser. It's nice when your server always formats errors in HTML!

* Copy & paste as cURL: Copy a request from Paw, you can just paste it anywhere as a cURL-formatted request.

* Keyboard Shortcuts: Don't waste time anymore with mouse, Paw is build with a few easy-to-learn shortcuts to save your time.

# License

Sorry for disappointing you, but Paw is not Open Source :( You can find it on the Mac App Store: [Paw HTTP Client](http://luckymarmot.com/paw/appstore) ... This is only an empty repository for Issue Tracking purposes.

But [Lucky Marmot](http://luckymarmot.com) is committed to release some Open Source works. All extensions for Paw, will be released under the MIT License. Also, I'm planning to release a whole Cocoa Text Library on GitHub in the near future (it will handle NSTextField, NSTextView, autocompletion, line folding, line counting, tokens, syntax highlighting ... a lot of cool stuff).
